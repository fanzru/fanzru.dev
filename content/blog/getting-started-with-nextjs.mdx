# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js has become one of the most popular React frameworks for building modern web applications. In this guide, we'll explore how to set up a new project with Next.js 14 and TypeScript, following best practices and optimizing for performance.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several advantages out of the box:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- Built-in routing and API routes
- Automatic code splitting
- TypeScript support
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- Image optimization

## Setting Up Your Project

First, create a new Next.js project with TypeScript:

```
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
cd my-app
```

### Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```text
my-app/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── layout.tsx
  │   └── page.tsx
  ├── components/
  │   └── Button.tsx
  ├── public/
  │   └── images/
  └── package.json
```

## Adding Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that works great with Next.js:

```
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

## Performance Optimization

Here are some tips for optimizing your Next.js application:

1. Use Image Component

```tsx
import Image from "next/image";

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <Image src="/hero.jpg" alt="Hero" width={1200} height={600} priority />
  );
}
```

2. Implement Dynamic Imports

```tsx
import dynamic from "next/dynamic";

const DynamicComponent = dynamic(() => import("../components/Heavy"));
```

## Conclusion

Next.js with TypeScript provides a robust foundation for building modern web applications. By following these best practices, you can create performant and maintainable applications that scale.
