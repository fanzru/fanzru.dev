# Getting Started with Next.js and TypeScript

Next.js is a powerful React framework that enables you to build fast, modern web applications. When combined with TypeScript, it provides an even more robust development experience with static typing and enhanced tooling support.

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version 18.17 or later)
- npm or yarn package manager
- A code editor (VS Code recommended)

## Creating a New Project

To create a new Next.js project with TypeScript, run the following command:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app --typescript
```

This will set up a new project with:

- TypeScript configuration
- ESLint for code linting
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- App Router for routing

## Project Structure

A typical Next.js project structure looks like this:

```
my-app/
  ├── app/
  │   ├── layout.tsx
  │   └── page.tsx
  ├── public/
  ├── components/
  ├── lib/
  ├── styles/
  ├── next.config.js
  └── tsconfig.json
```

## Adding TypeScript Types

TypeScript provides excellent type safety. Here's an example of a typed component:

```typescript
interface UserProps {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  email?: string;
}

export default function UserProfile({ name, age, email }: UserProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{name}</h1>
      <p>Age: {age}</p>
      {email && <p>Email: {email}</p>}
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use TypeScript for new components
2. Implement proper error boundaries
3. Use server components when possible
4. Optimize images using next/image
5. Implement proper metadata for SEO

## Performance Optimization

Next.js provides several features for optimizing your application:

- Automatic code splitting
- Server-side rendering
- Static site generation
- Image optimization
- Font optimization

## Conclusion

Next.js with TypeScript provides a robust foundation for building modern web applications. By following these best practices and utilizing the built-in features, you can create fast, type-safe, and maintainable applications.
